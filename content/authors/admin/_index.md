I am a Ph.D. student at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ([KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/)), working under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Fratalocchi at the Primalight research group ([Primalight](<>)), part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department. My research is centered around the design of AI-driven complex imaging and computational systems based on photonic metamaterials. 

My responsibility includes developing an effective Machine Learning solutions to the flat-optics optimization problem to create a complex imaging and photonics-based computational systems.
